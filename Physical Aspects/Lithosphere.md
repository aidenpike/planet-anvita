### Layers
The layers of Anvita are practically the same as the Earth, with an added [[magisphere]] between the [mantle](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mantle) and [asthenosphere](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/asthenosphere), which circulates through some elements to infuse them. 
## Tectonics
**Location**
![[Tectonic Plate Map.png]]
**History**
Originally the center island was apart of the leftmost continent, but due to some historically massive [[Natural Disasters|natural disasters]], the plate split and drifted eastward.
**Trend**
The plates are projected to curve towards each other in the next millennium, with the southern right continent expected to split and drift southeast.
