**Magic Pools** - Lakes or seas of water that happen to be above magic hot spots or happened to have water that was previously infused flood into the body of water can hold magic-infused pools of water.
**Lost Zone** - The Lost Zone is known to be a magic hot spot that has brought upon many fearful legends to traveling sailors around the world.
